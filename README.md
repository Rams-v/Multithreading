# Producer-Consumer Multithreading Example

## Description
This project demonstrates a basic producer-consumer scenario using multithreading in Java. The producer-consumer pattern involves two main components: a producer that produces items and adds them to a shared buffer, and a consumer that consumes items from the buffer.

## Files
1. Buffer.java: Defines a synchronized buffer where items are produced and consumed.
2. Producer.java: Implements a producer that generates random items and adds them to the buffer.
3. Consumer.java: Implements a consumer that consumes items from the buffer.
4. Main.java: Contains the main class that initializes the buffer, creates producer and consumer instances, starts their threads, and waits for their completion.

## Usage
To run the program, simply compile and execute the Main.java file. Make sure all the files are in the same package or directory.
